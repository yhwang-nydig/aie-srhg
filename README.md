- 24-hour async Slack channel to be staffed to get responses *within the workday*

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 1: Building & Vibe Checking Class RAG Applications</strong></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><em>✨ Intro &amp; Vibe Check</em>: Check the vibes on the LLM app you built during The AI Engineer Challenge and see how even naive context updates can have a big impact.</li>
    <li><em>🗃️ Dense Vector Retrieval</em>: Understand RAG from first principles, both conceptually and in code.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 2: Building and Monitoring Agentic RAG Applications</strong></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><em>🔁 The Agent Loop</em>: Understand what an “agent” is and how to use the latest abstractions to build production-grade agents quickly.</li>
    <li><em>🕴️ Agentic RAG</em>: Look under the hood of agentic RAG and the <code>create_agent</code> abstraction.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 3: Building More Complex Agentic Applications</strong></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><em>🔄 Multi-Agent Applications</em>: Learn when to add additional agents to optimize context and how to construct agent teams using common patterns.</li>
    <li><em>🧠 Agent Memory</em>: Learn how to build agents that manage both short- and long-term memory.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 4: Systematic Evals for Agentic RAG Applications</strong></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><em>🧪 Synthetic Data Generation for Evals</em>: Learn how to automatically generate test data for agentic RAG applications when no eval datasets exist.</li>
    <li><em>📊 Agentic RAG Evaluation</em>: Set up and implement effective evals for agents and RAG applications.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 5: Deeper on Agents &amp; RAG</strong></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><em>🐕 Advanced Retrievers</em>: Learn retrieval best practices and a systematic approach to choosing the right retriever for your AI applications.</li>
    <li><em>🔌 MCP Connectors</em>: Learn how to leverage collections of tools to enhance retrieval on the client side of MCP servers.</li>
    <li><em>📶 Deep Agents</em>: Build complex agents that operate over longer time horizons.</li>
    <li><em>🕵️ Deep Research</em>: Understand how deep research systems work under the hood and how to build them.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Week 6: Agent Servers &amp; Production Upgrades</strong></summary>

  <ul>
    <li><em>🚢 Agent Servers</em>: Learn to deploy complex agent applications to production endpoints you can use elsewhere.</li>
    <li><em>🔀 MCP Servers</em>: Learn how to set up MCP servers and enable public communication between agents.</li>
    <li><em>🛤️ Guardrails &amp; Caching</em>: Learn practical upgrades for performance, security, and trustworthiness.</li>
  </ul>
</details>



# **🧰 Tooling**

We will work within the AWS ecosystem and within the Deployment Process used by your organization; e.g.,

<details>
<summary><strong>SRHG Deployment Process</strong></summary>

1. GitHub
2. Write code in a feature branch
3. PR with CODEOWNERS approval to merge into `main`
4. GitHub Actions on ephemeral ARC CI/CD runners to build, test, and deploy Docker images to AWS ECR
5. Terraform manages declarative infrastructure in AWS
6. ArgoCD watches the `main` branch  
   - Auto-sync enabled for low-risk changes  
   - Manual sync required for higher-risk changes
7. Datadog for metrics, monitoring, APM, and logging

</details>

Specifically, we will leverage the following tooling in the curriculum and assignments:

- **Hardware Requirements**: Apple Macbook Pro, M-Chip Series
- **Cloud Service Provider**: AWS
- **LLM & Embedding Model Serving & Inference**: Anthropic Models through AWS Bedrock
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Coding Agent:** Claude Code (running locally)
- **MCP Servers**: Office365 ChatGPT connector, AWS Knowledgebase for Confluence (specific spaces)
- **Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph
- **Monitoring, Observability, and Deployment**: LangSmith
