OpenAI allows you to specify smaller dimensions (e.g., 256, 512, 1024) to reduce the size of the embeddings while maintaining most of the semantic information. This can help reduce storage costs and improve retrieval speed.\n",
    "2. OpenAI uses **Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)** to achieve this. MRL trains embeddings so that earlier dimensions contain the most important information, allowing truncation to smaller dimensions while preserving semantic meaning. This technique enables the embeddings to be effectively \"nested\" - smaller dimensional embeddings are contained within larger ones."

    "The async approach allows for **concurrent API calls** rather than sequential ones. When embedding multiple documents:\n",
    "- **Sync approach**: Makes one API call at a time, waiting for each to complete before starting the next. For 67 documents, this could take 67× the time of a single call.\n",
    "- **Async approach**: Initiates multiple API calls concurrently, allowing them to run in parallel. The program can continue processing while waiting for I/O operations (network requests) to complete.\n",

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicity's sake."

    "✅ Answer:\n",
    "Yes, there are two main ways to achieve more reproducible outputs from the OpenAI API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set `temperature=0`**: Temperature controls randomness in the output. Setting it to 0 makes the model deterministic by always selecting the highest probability token. Higher temperatures (0.7-2.0) increase randomness and creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use the `seed` parameter**: When combined with temperature=0, the seed parameter helps ensure deterministic outputs across API calls. Using the same seed value with the same inputs should produce the same outputs, though OpenAI notes that complete determinism is not guaranteed due to infrastructure changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",

      "Hello! The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on what you want to achieve. Generally, using a `for` loop is a clean and Pythonic approach when iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range). Here's a simple example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need more flexibility, such as looping until a certain condition is met, a `while` loop might be better:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",

      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",

      "Response: Based on the provided context from the 2025 Investor Letter and related excerpts, the key investment themes discussed include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Long-term Treasure Hunting Mindset:** The letter opens with a metaphor likening investment to a treasure hunt, emphasizing patience and perseverance. It references Mel Fisher, a treasure hunter who sought a sunken Spanish galleon for over 5,954 days, implying a disciplined, long-term approach to seeking hidden value or \"treasure\" that is not lost but waiting to be found. This suggests a theme of enduring commitment to uncovering investment opportunities that may take time to realize (\"The greatest treasure hunters know that the treasure they seek is not lost. It is waiting.\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operational Excellence and Scale in Energy Investments:** The letter highlights a focus on disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and continuous process improvement, specifically pointing to Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) becoming a top three U.S. hydrocarbon producer. This reflects an investment theme centered on scale, operational rigor, and practical impact, aiming to contribute meaningfully to U.S. economic competitiveness and society by managing large capital flows and operations (\"At our pace of disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and unrelenting process improvement, SRE will be a top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons.\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **American Capital Producing American Treasure:** More than 99% of the capital managed by Stone Ridge, including through SRE, originates from American investors. There is a patriotic or civic dimension underscoring the importance of leveraging American capital for American industry and economic benefit. This reflects a theme involving a responsible stewardship of domestic capital with an aim to generate tangible value for U.S. families and factories (\"More than 99% of the capital we manage at Stone Ridge, including SRE, comes from American investors. At Stone Ridge, American capital produces American treasure.\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Intellectual Rigor and Out-Thinking the Market:** The letter includes quotes and mentions \"OUTPHILOSOPHIZING,\" indicating an emphasis on intellectual discipline, continuous learning, and sophisticated thinking as a foundation for investment success (\"I can outlearn you. I can outread you. I can outthink you. And I can outphilosophize you.\"). This suggests a theme of leveraging unique analytical approaches and philosophy to gain an edge in investment decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Practical, Civic Impact:** The letter expresses a desire for Stone Ridge to matter in a civic and practical way similar to major infrastructure, like rail lines or ports, implying an investment philosophy that values tangible contributions and societal impact beyond financial returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that these themes emerge from the context provided, and the letter explicitly cautions that historical trends or views presented do not guarantee future performance and should not be taken as formal investment advice ([Source 3]).\n",

    "✅ Answer:\n",
    "You can use **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** to make the LLM have more thoughtful, detailed responses. This strategy involves instructing the model to \"think step by step\" or \"explain your reasoning\" before providing the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could modify the system prompt to include:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Before answering, think through the question step by step:\n",
    "1. What information from the context is relevant?\n",
    "2. How does this information relate to the question?\n",
    "3. What conclusions can be drawn?\n",
    "Then provide your detailed answer.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompting strategy encourages the model to break down complex reasoning into intermediate steps, leading to more accurate and comprehensive responses. It's particularly effective for questions requiring analysis, synthesis, or multi-step reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI also supports this with the extended thinking feature (using \"reasoning\" effort levels) which allows the model to spend more time reasoning before responding."

    "Enhance your Stone Ridge Investor Letter Assistant in some way! \n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Document Support**: Allow it to ingest multiple investor letters from different years for historical comparison\n",
    "- **New Distance Metric**: Implement a different similarity measure - does it improve retrieval for financial content?\n",
    "- **Metadata Support**: Add metadata like year, topic categories (market outlook, strategy, performance) to help filter results\n",
    "- **Different Embedding Model**: Try a different embedding model - does domain-specific tuning help for financial content?\n",
    "- **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Add the capability to ingest content from SEC filings, earnings calls, or other financial documents\n",
