INVESTMENT_PHILOSOPHY = (
    "Stone Ridge's investment philosophy centers on Bayesian thinking — continuously "
    "updating beliefs as new data arrives rather than anchoring to a single forecast. "
    "Key tenets from the 2025 Investor Letter include:\n\n"
    "1. **Diversification across independent risk factors**: True diversification "
    "requires exposure to return streams whose drivers are independent (e.g., "
    "catastrophe risk, energy supply/demand, bitcoin adoption).\n\n"
    "2. **Harvesting risk premiums others avoid**: Stone Ridge targets asset classes "
    "where structural or behavioral biases cause risk premiums to be larger than the "
    "expected loss — reinsurance and longtail catastrophe risk are prime examples.\n\n"
    "3. **Bayesian probability updating**: Rather than making binary bets, Stone Ridge "
    "assigns probabilities to outcomes and updates them with evidence, leading to "
    "measured position sizing.\n\n"
    "4. **Long time horizons and patience**: Many of Stone Ridge's strategies require "
    "a willingness to endure short-term volatility in exchange for long-term "
    "compounding of genuinely uncorrelated returns.\n\n"
    "5. **Radical transparency**: The annual investor letter provides detailed "
    "discussion of mistakes, lessons learned, and evolving views."
