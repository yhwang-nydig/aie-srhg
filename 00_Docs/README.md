👋 Welcome to The Agent Engineering Docs.

**`Docs` typically indicate the place where you can find additional useful information on the stuff you're trying to build.** 

That's what these docs are for, tool!

Another way to think about this is that Docs represent our evolving `Agent Engineering Textbook`.

Each `module` in `Modules` s designed to be read _before watching lectures and code demos, and before completing assignments_. Of course, like any textbook that you're supposed to read before class, it works just as good after class as well!

Although we will sequence material slightly differently than we have shown below, this formulation is useful for seeing the very few lego blocks we actually need to learn.
